# Palindrome Checker Management System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Palindrome Checker Management System** is a Java-based console application designed to demonstrate structured software development using a use-case driven implementation approach.

This initial version establishes the **application entry point and startup flow**.  
No palindrome-checking logic has been implemented yet — this stage focuses on clean architecture and proper program initialization.

## 🚀 Use Case 1 – Application Entry & Welcome Message

### ✔ Features Implemented

- Application starts from the `main()` method
- Displays a structured welcome banner
- Shows:
  - Application Name
  - Version Number
- Confirms successful system initialization

### 🖥 Sample Output

```
==========================================
   Welcome to Palindrome Checker System
==========================================
Application Name : Palindrome Checker
Version          : 1.0

System initialized successfully.
Ready for next use case...
```
