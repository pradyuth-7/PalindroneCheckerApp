# Palindrome Checker System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Palindrome Checker System** is a Java-based console application developed using **IntelliJ IDEA**.  
This project is being built step by step using clear **use cases**.

At **Version 1.0**, the application only handles:
- Program startup
- Displaying a welcome message
- Showing application metadata (name & version)

⚠️ **Note:** No palindrome checking logic is implemented yet.  
This version focuses purely on establishing a clean and structured entry point.
